## Git Workflow

**1. Create a working branch**

Name branches with your initials followed by a description of the change you're going to make. For example:

> **ss-backend-institute-api**<br>
> **ss-add-new-dependecy**

**2. Make changes, rebase as you go**

If you're working on a feature or bug fix that will take multiple days, it is recommended to rebase your branch to the parent branch each morning before you continue working. This will keep your branch up-to-date and minimize the amount of conflicts you'll need to resolve before merging the PR.
